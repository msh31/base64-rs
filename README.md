# base64-rs
A simple base64 encoder / decoder to get familiar with rust in my spare time.

## Usage
```bash
base64-rs encode "text-to-encode"
# or
base64-rs decode "text_to_decode"
```

## Background
Since I've been doing C++ for a couple months, and watch YouTube about programming, I've heard some great things about rust.
I figured I'd give it a try, to see what it is like.

## Retrospect
- TODO

## Compile / run
```bash
# it's as simple as this:
cargo build
cargo run
```

#### but wait, where's the executable?
#### -> .\target\debug\base64-rs(.exe) | or release, dependsd on your config
